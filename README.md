Introcution

*MPTT or Modified Preorder Tree Traversal* is an intelligent transformation of the standard *Preorder Tree Traversal* algorithm to query and traverse large hierarchical dataset. The algorithm and the general way of implementation in PHP is documented very well in the wonderful [article](http://www.sitepoint.com/hierarchical-data-database-2/) written by *Gijs Van Tulder* at [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/).
